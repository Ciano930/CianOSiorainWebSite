          <div id="header">
            An eternal creator. As an avid hobbyist and artist I enjoy working on many projects from Model kits, Costuming and, Minature painting. Have a look at some of my projects and see what work I have done.
            <div class="row">
              <div id="Warhammer">Since my father bought me my first box of skeleton horsemen from Games Workshop as a young boy I've always loved minatures and wargaming! Even now nearly twenty years later I still collect, build, paint and play often! Currently I collect a number of armies but to this day I still love skeletons and the armies of Death!</div>
              <div id="Costuming">Back in college while speaking with a friend coming up to halloween I was dared to build an Iron Man suit. This started a hobby that while I don't do often any more I still have fond memories of those days and hope tp return to suiting up again soon. I still go out with the "Predators Ireland" group in my custom suit "Mr Cuddles" based on the classic 1987 film!</div>
              <div id="Gunpla">Mobile Suit Gundam! What a series! I remember playing with a Gundam wing model I bought from a gashapon in France and since then the series has always fascinated me. So when I heard that Gundam had a model line that was essential to its development I had to get involved! Now I have well over fifty gunpla and I enjoy customising these models to my own tastes!</div>

        <div class="project" id="Coding">
          <div id="header">
             Curiosity in programming. Since starting in Computer Science programming has been a huge part of my life. As programming is as close we can get to magic I enjoy the problem solving of creation!
            <div class="row">
              <div id="Web Design">An area of increasing excitment for me! Learning how to design, develop and deploy a website is still an area I am thoroughly excited to be exploring! As of this site I am enjoying learning CSS3 animation and Bootstrap with the intention for mobile devices. And eventually hybrid applications.</div>
              <div id="App Design">In CTYI I taught many courses starting with App development! In App design I used MIT's App Inventor to teach young people the excitement of mobile applications! Such as personal apps with games and music. My favourite app during that time has to be Sushi cat! I'm currently looking to learn how to incorperate my web applications into Mobile apps through the use of Restful API services and hybrid app deployment!</div>
              <div id="Video Games">When I first started to program I struggled with a number of areas. However I was fortunate enough to have a tutor who loved programming and, loved video games! His passion inspired me to work hard and over come this early stumbling block and in a few weeks I had completed my first game! Troll Roll! To date I've learned much about game design and in my own time I hope to complete my current game IPT-2093 a space trader game!</div>

        <div class="project" id="Community">
          <div id="header">
            Community matters deeply to me. From the community in the Games Workshop, my colleagues in CTYI and my friends in the Costuming community I try to join in where I can and contribute what I can.
            <div class="row">
              <div id="Teaching">For a number of years now I have served as an instructor in the Centre for Talented Youth Ireland, or CTYI for short. There I teach course on programming, animation, App design and other cool subjects! Introducing young people to topics like these is always exciting and I enjoy developing my own practices as I learn with them. I have recently completed a course on TELF methodology with TEFL.UK.ORG and have started using these lessons in my own classes.</div>
